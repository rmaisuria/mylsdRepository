ISD lab sheet week 2

Github: 
1) If you haven’t done so yet, please sign up for Github https://github.com/
2) Create a repository for your source code
3) Commit (upload) the code from week 1 to your repository

For the practical part of this lab please save the Python programs that you create and take screenshots of the execution (evaluation) of your programs. Commit (upload) all source code you create to your code repository. 
1.	What will the output be from the following code?
num = 4
num*=2
num1=num+2
num1+=3
print(num1) = 13

2.	What do the following lines of code output? Why do they give a different answer?
print(2 / 3) 0.6666666666666666

print(2 // 3) 0
because they are 2 different equations and so the program would divide the answer twice

3.	All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the better variable name to use?
A       a       Area      AREA        area      areaOfRectangle       AreaOfRectangle
“area” is the best to use as it is the most simple and cleary understandable variable name for the computer to understand



4.	Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one might be wrong.)
apple      APPLE     Apple2        1Apple   account number          account_number       account.number    accountNumber       fred  Fred   return   return_value   5Return
GreatBigVariable   greatBigVariable   great_big_variable   great.big.variable     2x 

These 3 are wrong or invalid as the computer would find it difficult to read as a number infront of a letter would make the computer confused.
5.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = int(input("Radius:"))
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * (radius * 2) – this is wrong because it should be in brackets

there are 2 mistakes, where in the equation it should only show one * when it actually showed 2. The equation also has the INT command missing as because we are dealing with numbers the equation would need the INT command to process what every value is being inputted as a number not a string letter.


6.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a =3*(x + y)
a=27

7.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))

8.	Why does this code not calculate the average?
print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)

9.	Consider the following code:
x = 19.93
y = 20.00
z = y – x
print(z)
The output is 0.0700000000028    Why ?   
Improve the code so that the output is to two decimal places.

10.	Find at least three compile-time errors:
int x = 2
Print (x, squared is, x * x)
xcubed = x *** 3


11.	Find two run-time errors:
from math import sqrt
X = 2
Y = 4
print(“The product of “, x, “and”, y, “is”, x + y)
print(“The root of their difference is “, sqrt(x – y))

12.	Write statements to prompt user for their name and age
Write a print statement to output:
Hello ____, next year you will be ____ years old!

13.	Given that radius is 2 and area is calculated as 12.5678, use string format operators to print the values of the variables radius and area so that the output looks like this:
Radius is: 	          2
Area is:	  12.57

14.	What are the values of the following expressions, assuming that p is 17 and q is 18?
i.	p // 10 + p % 10
ii.	p % 2  + q % 2
iii.	(p + q) // 2
iv.	(p + q) / 2.0
